## Introduction

### History, Version and Editions

- Started by James Gosling in year 1991 as the Oak programming language. As of year 2012, the latest version is Java 7 (version 1.7).

- There are several editions of Java optimized for different purposes.

- This note starts with **Java SE (Standard Edition)** that covers the basics.

- **Java EE (Enterprise Edition)** is more advanced and is widely used in the industry.

### Basic Information

- Java is an **object-oriented** programming language that is loosely based on C++. It focuses on interactions of objects instead of just step-by-step procedures *(while it is all right to learn Java as the first programming language, learning a procedural programming language such as C before moving into an object-oriented language like Java could make the learning process easier)*.

- Java is **platform independent**. A Java program can be easily made to run on Windows, UNIX, Linux and Mac OS with little or no modification on the code.

- There are many more advanced features but knowing these should be good for starter.
