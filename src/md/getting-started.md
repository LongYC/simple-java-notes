# Getting Started With Java

Basic understanding and set up are essential before writing Java programs.

## How Java Works

- Write Java source code in normal text files with **.java** extension, e.g. *LongYC.java*

- Compile the source code into **.class** files, e.g. *LongYC.class*

- The .class files contain **bytecodes** which can be **interpreted by a JVM (Java Virtual Machine)** software to produce desired results.

## Requirements

- **JRE (Java Runtime Environment)** is required to run Java programmes; JRE includes JVM.

- **JDK (Java Development Kit)** is required to compile Java source code into bytecodes; JDK includes JRE.

- JRE & JDK for various platforms are available for download from [Oracle official website](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html "Java SE - Downloads | Oracle Technology Network | Oracle").
