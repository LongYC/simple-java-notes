# Introduction To Java Programming

While it is all right to learn Java as your first programming language, I highly recommend you to learn a procedural programming language (such as C) before moving into an object-oriented language like Java. It will make the learning process a lot easier.

## History, Version and Editions

- Started by James Gosling in year 1991 as the Oak programming language. As of year 2012, the latest version is Java 7 (version 1.7).

- There are several editions of Java optimised for different purposes.

- This note starts with **Java SE (Standard Edition)** that covers the basics.

- **Java EE (Enterprise Edition)** is more advanced and is widely used in the industry

## Basic Information

- Java is an **object-oriented** programming language that is loosely based on C++. It focuses on interactions of objects instead of just step-by-step procedures.

- Java is **platform independent**. A Java program can be easily made to run on Windows, UNIX, Linux and Mac with little or no modification on the code.

- There are many more advanced features but knowing these should be good for starter.
